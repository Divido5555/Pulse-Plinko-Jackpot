<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to complete the development of a Pulse369 DAO Plinko Jackpot game. The project has pivoted to its final version, which is a fully on-chain game powered by a custom  ERC-20 token and Fetch Oracle for randomness.

The immediate task is to integrate the existing React frontend with the already deployed smart contracts on the PulseChain mainnet.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Wallet Integration:** The frontend must connect to a user's wallet (e.g., MetaMask), detect the PulseChain network (ID 369), and display the user's  token balance.
2.  **Game Contract Integration:** The Play button functionality must be wired to the smart contract. This involves:
    *   Checking token  and prompting for  if necessary.
    *   Calling the  function on the game contract.
    *   The outcome of the game (which slot the puck lands in) is determined authoritatively by the  event emitted from the contract transaction, not by the frontend physics.
3.  **UI Data Sync:**
    *   Update the UI to show 20 prize slots instead of 24, with multipliers matching the contract.
    *   Display the correct entry price: 10 PLS369.
    *   Fetch and display real-time jackpot values from the  contract function.

**what currently exists?**
The project is on the  branch, which contains the final, authoritative version of the code. This includes:
- A polished React frontend that is currently in a visual-only demo mode with mock data.
- Deployed and finalized smart contracts on PulseChain mainnet:
    -  (Token Address: )
    -  (Game Address: )
- A full suite of documentation (, , etc.) and test files for the new system.
- All legacy code (previous VRF-based and PLS-based versions) has been moved to a  directory.
-  has been added to the frontend dependencies.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent began the frontend-to-contract integration task by installing the  library.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Manual testing. This task requires connecting a real wallet (like MetaMask) with PLS (for gas) and PLS369 tokens on the PulseChain network to interact with the frontend.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no outstanding bugs. The work is focused on a single, large feature implementation.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Complete Wallet and Smart Contract Integration (P0)**
    - **Where to resume:** The agent has installed . The next step is to create a configuration file in the frontend ( or similar) to store the contract addresses and ABIs, and then proceed with implementing the wallet connection logic.
    - **What will be achieved with this?** The Plinko game will become fully functional, allowing users to connect their wallets and play using real  tokens on the PulseChain mainnet.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    - **Blocked on something:** None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- There are no other scheduled tasks. The current focus is solely on completing the mainnet integration.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Major Project Pivot & Cleanup:**
    - Executed a complete pivot from a native PLS-based game to a  token-based game.
    - Created the final smart contracts:  and .
    - Rewrote all project documentation (, etc.) to reflect the final tokenomics and game mechanics.
    - Cleaned the repository by moving all old and deprecated contract files and documents into a  folder.
    - Synced the  branch to be the single source of truth for the final project version.
- **Frontend UI Refinement:**
    - Iteratively designed the Plinko board UI, including correcting the peg layout (to a staggered grid), optimizing peg spacing, and adding blockers at the top to prevent edge-channel drops.
- **Initial Integration Step:**
    - Installed  in the frontend project.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- **Issue 1: Preview URL Synchronization**
    - The user previously faced issues where the preview URL would not update with the latest changes. This was attributed to a mix of server state, caching, and environment confusion between the original and forked projects.
    - **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** This issue is currently low priority as the user has pivoted to integrating with mainnet contracts directly, bypassing the need for a preview URL for the time being. However, if future feature development is required on a new fork, this issue may resurface.
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** Frontend
    - **Is recurring issue?** Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, ethers.js v6, CSS
- **Blockchain:** Solidity, PulseChain (ChainID 369), ERC-20
- **3rd Party Services:** Fetch Oracle (for on-chain randomness)
- **Game Logic:** The game's outcome is determined 100% on-chain by the  contract. The frontend is responsible for triggering the transaction and visually animating the result based on the contract's event log.

**key DB schema**
- N/A (The application is decentralized and does not use a database for its core logic).

**changes in tech stack**
- **ethers.js v6** was added to the frontend to enable wallet and contract communication.
- The application's core logic has shifted from being mocked on the frontend to being authoritatively handled by on-chain smart contracts.

**All files of reference**
- : Main component to implement wallet connection and  function logic.
- : UI component that needs its slot rendering logic updated from 24 to 20 slots.
- : Configuration file defining prize slots and multipliers; must be updated to match the contract.
- : The source of truth for all game logic, events, and state.
- : Contains the finalized overview of the project, architecture, and economics.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- ****: The  function and state management for player balance and jackpots must be completely refactored to remove mock data and integrate with blockchain reads/writes.

**key api endpoints**
All key interactions are with the smart contracts on PulseChain:
-  ()
  - 
  - 
  - 
-  ()
  - 
  - 

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **The Pivot is Final:** All work must align with the  token-based game. Ignore any prior context related to VRF, native PLS entry fees, or different wallet structures (, ). The user's last several messages define the authoritative plan.
- **On-Chain Authoritative:** The game's result is decided by the smart contract's  event, not the frontend. The frontend animation must reflect the slot number returned in the transaction receipt.
- **Mainnet Contracts:** Use the provided mainnet addresses for the token and game contracts. No mock or testnet addresses.
- **Next Step:** Your immediate task is to create a contract configuration file in the frontend () containing the provided addresses and contract ABIs, then proceed with the wallet connection logic in .

**documents created in this job**
- 
- 
- 
- 
-  (Updated final version)
- All legacy files were moved into a  directory.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending user messages**
The user's last several messages provided a detailed, multi-step handoff package to pivot the project to its final form (the PLS369 token game), clean up the repository, and begin the frontend integration with deployed mainnet contracts. All these instructions are captured in the current plan. The last message explicitly lists the integration priorities.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:** The core game functionality is broken as the frontend is not connected to the blockchain.
- **Mocked:** Player balance, jackpot values, and the entire game play logic are currently mocked in the React components.

**3rd Party Integrations**:
- **Fetch Oracle:** Used on-chain by the  contract to provide randomness. No frontend interaction is required.
- **Ethers.js v6:** A new frontend dependency for wallet and contract communication.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES, a  was used to diagnose a preview URL issue, though the root cause was environmental.
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** Yes.
- **Test files created:**  (for the final contract).
- **Known regressions:** None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
- A browser wallet (e.g., MetaMask) configured for the PulseChain Mainnet (ChainID: 369).
- The wallet must be funded with  (for gas) and  tokens to play.

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent was in the process of executing the user's latest plan. It installed  but has not yet created the necessary configuration file for the contract ABIs and addresses, which is the logical next step before implementing the wallet connection.</analysis>
