# PLS369 Tokenomics

## Overview

PLS369 is a **fixed-supply distribution token** designed to power the PLS369 DAO Plinko game and serve as the primary value-accrual mechanism for the DAO ecosystem.

---

## Token Specifications

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | PLS369 DAO |
| **Symbol** | PLS369 |
| **Decimals** | 18 |
| **Total Supply** | 369,000,000 PLS369 |
| **Supply Type** | Fixed (no minting/burning) |
| **Contract Type** | Standard ERC-20 |

---

## Supply Distribution (Suggested)

The entire 369M supply is minted to the DAO deployer (multisig) at launch. Distribution is managed off-chain by the DAO:

| Allocation | Amount | Percentage | Purpose |
|------------|--------|------------|---------|
| **Liquidity Pool** | 147.6M | 40% | PLS/PLS369 DEX liquidity |
| **DAO Treasury** | 110.7M | 30% | Long-term reserves + buybacks |
| **Game Seeding** | 55.35M | 15% | Initial jackpots + prizes |
| **Team/Contributors** | 36.9M | 10% | Vesting over 12-24 months |
| **Community** | 18.45M | 5% | Airdrops, marketing, early adopters |

**Note**: These percentages are guidelines. The DAO controls final distribution.

## Token Utility

### Primary Use Case: Game Entry

- **Entry Price**: 10 PLS369 per play
- Players must hold PLS369 to participate
- Creates constant buy pressure on PulseX

### Value Accrual Mechanisms

1. **Game-Based Emission**
   - The game IS the emission schedule
   - No inflation curve
   - Token distributed through prizes + jackpots

2. **DAO Revenue**
   - 4% of every play goes to DAO treasury
   - DAO can:
     - Buy PLS with revenue
     - Deposit into LiquidLoans vaults
     - Add to LP
     - Fund development

3. **Dev Revenue**
   - 3% of every play goes to dev wallet
   - Funds ongoing development and maintenance

4. **Jackpot Accumulation**
   - 40% of every play → main jackpot
   - 10% of every play → mini jackpot
   - Jackpots create FOMO and viral marketing

---

## Economic Model

### Demand Drivers

1. **Play-to-Win**
   - Players buy PLS369 to play
   - Regular prizes (2x-5x multipliers)
   - Life-changing jackpots (1 in 33k for main)

2. **Speculation**
   - Fixed supply
   - Deflationary pressure from game usage
   - DAO buybacks with revenue

3. **DAO Participation**
   - Governance rights (future)
   - Revenue sharing (future)
   - Vault deposits (future)

### Supply Dynamics

- **No new minting** (fixed 369M forever)
- **No burning** (stable supply)
- **Circulating supply** increases as DAO distributes
- **Game prizes** recirculate tokens from jackpots back to players

---

## Liquidity Strategy

### Initial Liquidity

1. **PulseX LP**: 147.6M PLS369 + PLS
   - Primary trading pair
   - Locked or owned by DAO Safe
   - Deep liquidity for smooth gameplay

2. **CEX Listings** (future)
   - Once mainnet proven
   - Additional liquidity + exposure

### Ongoing Liquidity Management

- DAO treasury uses revenue to:
  - Add to LP (increase depth)
  - Execute strategic buybacks
  - Maintain price stability during high volume

---

## Treasury Management (Future Phases)

### Phase 1: Game Launch
- Focus on liquidity and gameplay
- Accumulate DAO revenue in PLS369

### Phase 2: PLS Conversion
- Convert DAO PLS369 revenue → PLS
- Use PLS for LiquidLoans vault deposits
- Generate yield for DAO

### Phase 3: Advanced Treasury
- Multi-asset treasury (PLS, PLS369, stablecoins)
- Yield farming strategies
- Strategic token swaps
- Governance token distribution

---

## Token Velocity

### Target Velocity: Medium-High

- **High turnover** from gameplay
- **Medium hold time** for speculators
- **Low velocity** for LP tokens (locked)

### Balanced Approach

- Game creates natural circulation
- Jackpots incentivize holding (FOMO)
- DAO revenue creates permanent demand sink

---

## Comparison to Other Models

| Model | PLS369 | Typical GameFi | Casino Token |
|-------|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **Supply** | Fixed (369M) | Inflationary | Deflationary (burn) |
| **Emission** | Game prizes | Staking rewards | Buy & burn |
| **Revenue** | DAO + Dev | Protocol fees | House edge |
| **Utility** | Entry + governance | Staking | Betting |
| **Sustainability** | Self-sustaining loop | Requires growth | Requires volume |

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Supply Risk
- ✅ Fixed supply (no surprise inflation)
- ✅ DAO-controlled distribution
- ⚠️ Large treasury holdings (managed by multisig)

### Liquidity Risk
- ✅ Large LP allocation (40%)
- ✅ DAO can add more liquidity
- ⚠️ Dependent on PLS price

### Demand Risk
- ✅ Game provides intrinsic utility
- ✅ Jackpots create viral marketing
- ⚠️ Requires player acquisition

---

## Long-Term Vision

### Year 1: Establish Distribution
- Launch game on mainnet
- Distribute initial supply
- Build player base
- Accumulate DAO treasury

### Year 2: Expand Utility
- Add governance features
- Launch revenue sharing
- Integrate with DeFi protocols
- Expand game mechanics

### Year 3: DAO Autonomy
- Fully decentralized governance
- Multi-game ecosystem
- Cross-chain expansion
- Self-sustaining economy

---

## Key Metrics to Track

1. **Circulating Supply**: Tokens distributed by DAO
2. **LP Depth**: PLS369/PLS liquidity
3. **Daily Volume**: Trading + game usage
4. **DAO Treasury**: Accrued PLS369 + PLS
5. **Unique Players**: Active user count
6. **Jackpot Size**: Main + mini totals

---

## Summary

PLS369 is designed as a **distribution token** where:

- Fixed supply ensures scarcity
- Game provides intrinsic utility
- DAO captures value via revenue share
- Players benefit from prizes and jackpots
- Ecosystem grows through positive feedback loops

**The game is the tokenomics.**
